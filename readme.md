# Sherlock Game

Sherlock is an adaptation of the classic Mastermind game, realised in accordance to Unreal coding standards and thanks to the great course by Ben Tristem on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/content).

## The rules

Simply put: try to guess the code. The game will give you clues and the goal is to guess right using as less tries as possible.
